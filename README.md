# Project_Euler

This is my set of solutions for Project Euler done in python. This repository is for personal and professional reference, learning how to use GitHub, and community discussion.

If you are trying to solve the Project Euler problems yourself, please do not use solution sets unless it is your absolute final resource. The PE+ problems exist to challenge the way you think, and looking up a solution doesn't help you grow as a problem solver. On the other hand, if you hit a brick wall, not progressing isn't helpful to your growth either. I urge you all to challenge yourselves, and when you come up with a solution, let me know if mine could use some improvement. :)
